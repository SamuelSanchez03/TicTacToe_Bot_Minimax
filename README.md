# TicTacToe Bot with Minimax Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning
This project is a TicTacToe Bot implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The bot uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to make intelligent moves.

## About the Game
TicTacToe is a classic two-player game where players take turns placing their marks (either X's or O's) on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to win the game. If the grid is full and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## About the Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence. It is designed to determine the best move for a player by recursively evaluating all possible moves and their outcomes. Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique used with the Minimax algorithm to reduce the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, making the algorithm more efficient.
